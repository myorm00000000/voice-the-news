# [Final Year Project] - Voice The News
--------------------------------------

What is Voice The News ?
------
Voice the News is a news reading mobile application for android. The applicationâ€™s purpose is to provide users with 
current and updated news from malaysiakini.com and voice out the news to the user. 

The application provide three different news language for user to choose from which is English, Bahasa Malaysia, and Chinese. Once a news is clicked, the application will automatically voice out the current news. The flow of the voice can be freely control by the user. The user can choose to rewind the previous paragraph, pause the voice, resume the voice, voice out the next paragraph and stop the voice. Once the current news reached the last paragraph/sentence and the voice finished speaking, the application will voice out the next news automatically.

About
-----
The Final Year Project is a part of my course structure which is Bachelor of Computer Science with Specialization Software Engineering from Multimedia University (MMU) Cyberjaya. Special thanks to my project supervisor, Dr. Ian Chai (ianchai@mmu.edu.my) for guiding me until the end of the project.

Voice The News is not affliated with MalaysiaKini in anyway and any organization/company other than Multimedia University (MMU) itself.
